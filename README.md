## Overview

This is my winter-themed website, designed with a minimalist South Park-inspired aesthetic. The scene features a snowy forest under a starry night sky with a glowing crescent moon. A custom geometric logo appears in the center, blending soft pastel tones. At the bottom, there are transparent icons linking to Discord, Steam, Instagram, and Twitter. A character resembling Kenny stands on the right side of the screen.

The site is clean, lightweight, and designed as a personal landing page with a focus on visual style and atmosphere.
